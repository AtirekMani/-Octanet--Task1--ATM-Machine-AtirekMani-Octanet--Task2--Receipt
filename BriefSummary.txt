The Java code is a receipt calculator for a pizza shop, allowing users to select a pizza type (Veg or Non-Veg) and whether they want a premium pizza. Users can then add toppings like cheese, chicken, or onion, each with a different price. The program applies a discount for online platform orders (e.g., Swiggy or Zomato) and adds a 5% tax to the final amount. The total bill is then calculated and displayed. The code uses a Receipt class with methods to calculate the base cost, add toppings, apply discounts, and add tax.
